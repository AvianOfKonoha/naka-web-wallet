# üßæ NAKA Web Wallet
**Built with Vue + Vite + TypeScript + Web3.js**

**Vault dApp** is a lightweight, browser‚Äëbased minimal Vite setup and a Vue-based client that interacts with Polygon smart contracts using **Web3.js**. Users can create personal **Vault contracts** via a **VaultRegistry factory**, manage assets, and handle deposits, withdrawals, and KYC settings securely through **MetaMask**.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Users

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- **MetaMask** browser extension installed and set up. [Get MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Brave, etc.) with JavaScript enabled.

---
### üîß Running the Project

For **Windows users**, simply double-click the included `start_WIN.bat` file in the project directory. This batch file will:

- Start a local HTTP server serving the project files on port 8000.
- Automatically open your default web browser to `http://localhost:8000`.


---
### üçé macOS

1. Double-click `start_macOS.command`.

   > If it doesn't open, run the following once in Terminal to make it executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x start_macOS.command
   ```
---

If you prefer to start the server manually, or are on a different OS, you can use Python‚Äôs built-in HTTP server:

```bash
python serve_dist.py
```
---


## üë®‚Äçüíª Quick Start for Developers

Here‚Äôs how to interact with the dApp programmatically using **Web3.js**.

### 1. Connect MetaMask

```ts
import Web3 from "web3";

let web3: Web3;
let accounts: string[] = [];

async function connectMetaMask() {
   if (!window.ethereum) {
      alert("MetaMask not detected!");
      return;
   }
   try {
      web3 = new Web3(window.ethereum);
      accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ method: "eth_requestAccounts" });
      console.log("Connected account:", accounts[0]);
   } catch (error) {
      console.error(error)
   }
}
```

### 2. Create a Vault via the VaultRegistry

```ts
import VaultRegistryABI from "./abi/VaultRegistry.json";

const registryAddress = "0x..."; // Deployed VaultRegistry address
const registry = new web3.eth.Contract(VaultRegistryABI, registryAddress);

async function createVault() {
   try {
      const owner = accounts[0];
      const tx = await registry.methods.createVault(owner).send({ from: owner });
      console.log("Vault created, receipt:", tx);
      // Vault address is in tx.events.VaultCreated.returnValues.vaultAddress
   } catch (error) {
      console.error(error)
   }
}
```


### 3. Interact with your Vault

```ts
import VaultABI from "./abi/Vault.json";

async function depositToVault(vaultAddress: string, tokenAddress: string, amountUsdt: bigint) {
   const vault = new web3.eth.Contract(VaultABI, vaultAddress);

   try {
      await vault.methods.deposit(tokenAddress, amountUsdt).send({
         from: accounts[0],
         value: tokenAddress === "0x0..." ? amountWei : "0"
      });
      console.log("Deposit successful");
   } catch (error) {
      console.error(error)
   }
}

async function requestWithdrawFromVault(vaultAddress: string, tokenAddress: string, recipient: string, amountUsdt: bigint) {
   const vault = new web3.eth.Contract(VaultABI, vaultAddress);

   try {
      await vault.methods.withdraw(tokenAddress, recipient, amountUsdt).send({ from: accounts[0] });
      console.log("Withdrawal successful");
   } catch (error) {
      console.error(error)
   }
}

async function withdrawFromVault(vaultAddress: string, tokenAddress: string, recipient: string, amountUsdt: bigint) {
   const vault = new web3.eth.Contract(VaultABI, vaultAddress);

   try {
      await vault.methods.withdraw(tokenAddress, recipient, amountUsdt).send({ from: accounts[0] });
      console.log("Withdrawal successful");
   } catch (error) {
      console.error(error)
   }
}
```
